This was my first attempt creating a very simple game, it ended out ok as a neat little highscore game.

In order for you to build it, you will need a C++11 compiler and the following libraries. (see instructions.)

    * SDL-1.2
    * SDL-image1.2
    * SDL-mixer1.2
    * SDL-ttf1.2
    * libPhysFS

Build instructions (debian/ubuntu)

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :tangle yes

  sudo apt install build-essential libphysfs-dev \
       libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev  \
       libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev \
       libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

  # Get the code
  git clone git@github.com:davidwik/spacefight.git

  cd spacefight
  # Compile and link
  make

  # Enjoy
  ./spacefight

#+END_SRC
