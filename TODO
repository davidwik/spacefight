# WISHLIST

* Fix player animation, three animations
  in total - still, moving forward, moving backward.
  [SOLVED]

* Come up with a smart way of sharing all the animations for sprites
  and enemies. Right now, gameobject creates new animations every time
  which is a waste of memory.
  [SOLVED] Created a animationlibrary for the gameobject.

* If animation not found. It shouldn't CRASH! Rather quit with message.
  Use map.count(key) to check whether a key exists!
  [SOLVED]

* Implement a purge method to cleanup animationlibrary.
  [SOLVED]


* It could be neat to clone an animation if you want to flip it, and not
  flip all other animations.
  [SOLVED]

* Make some enemies GFX
  [SOLVED]

* Merge an animation. explain?


* Make a monster factory! Which takes a map of animations as argument. or better.



* Make enemies move around. Fairly randomly.

* Implement restrictions on Gameobject from screen. Screen collision.
