* Fix player animation, three animations 
  in total - still, moving forward, moving backward.
  [SOLVED] 
* Come up with a smart way of sharing all the animations for sprites
  and enemies. Right now, gameobject creates new animations every time
  which is a waste of memory. 
  [SOLVED] Created a animationlibrary for the gameobject. 

* Make some enemies

* Make enemies move around. Fairly randomly.

* Implement restrictions on Gameobject from screen. Screen collision.
